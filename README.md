# Panache Sports Documentation
Welcome to the official repository for Panache Sports "Equal Play" documents.

## Get involved

The aim of Panache Sports "Equal Play" project is to provide the best quality documentation to sports organisations and athletes.

As we work to support organisations and athletes we are constantly re-evaluating and updating our documents to reflect the latest rules, laws and requirements and as we bring on board organisations and athletes from different sporting disciplines and territories we will add new documents specific to them and also evaluate if any details care relevant to existing documents.

But we need your help.  If you'd like to contribute to this project, be that by providing new documents or by updating existing documents then please get in contact, or issue a pull request to this repository with your documented changes.

## Diversity, Equality and Inclusion

This is at the core of Panache Sports "Equal Play" project.

We know that leading sports organisations are proactively focusing on DE&I, with particular interest in the growing are of women's sports and initiatives to engage with underrepresented groups, but often contracts and documents within organisations were created without this in mind and have not be changed since creation.

We want to ensure that the documentation available here has DE&I at its core with clauses and language that caters for all.

If you identify clauses or language within these documents that could be updated or added to then we'd love to hear from you and welcome contributions.

## Panache Sports Platform

The Panache Sports platform provides AI enhanced legal risk management for organisations, agents and athletes.  It allows you to manage your organisations and associated players and staff to ensure that any legal risks are minimised and your processes around signing are all handled in in a single repository.

The documents provided here are built directly into the Panache Sports platform, along with additional documents (like commercial agreements) that may not be appropriate to this project.  They form the basis to the built in processes provided by the platform.
